# IOG-Service-Delivery-Software-Install

The authority to install software on a company device comes only from Software Licencing Team (ITAM) by way of a software install request ticket.

A request to install software is received via a change activity.

The request will detail the following:


a) The software to be installed

b) The requester's name

c) The intended recipient (if they are not the requester)

d) The targeted device for the install

e) A link to the location of the software to be installed

f) Any specific instructions required for the install 



For each request where a licence key is required for the software this is delivered into the Teams channel OG-IOG-Software Licences for Installs. An entry will be made by the ITAM team referencing the change activity ticket and providing the licence key.

Once all the information is provided the analyst will contact the user to install the software following the instructions provided, where none were provided the installation shall follow all defaults for install. 

The analyst should input any provided licence key when requested during the install. The licence key should not be shared with the requester, targeted user or placed in the change activity ticket.

If we cannot install the software due to a licencing error, update the ticket and escalate to Software Licencing (B2B or RISK).

If we cannot install the software due to an error with the installer package or local machine, update the ticket and escalate to the appropriate Level 2 IT Support Team.

If we cannot install the software because we are unable to get a response from the recipient and we have followed the approved process for contact and follow-ups. Update the ticket accordingly, and set the status to reject the activity ticket
